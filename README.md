# Introduction to Computational Thinking

## About the project
This repository contain **my notes and my own solutions** to the given homeworks and projects. The main focus to taking this course is to get a solid foundation in computational thinking.

According to Alan Edelman, one of the creators of `Julia`, computational science can be summed up by a simplified workflow: ***data -> input -> process -> model -> visualize -> otput***.

This content is based on the MIT course [MIT 18.S191/6.S083/22.S092 Introduction to Computational Thinking - Spring 2021](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/). These notes are not the exact original of the given in the course since I modified them adding and deleting content according to my workflow.

## How to run the Pluto Notebooks
- [Download](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and **install** the programming languaje `Julia`.
- **Install** the `Pluto` package, a package of `Julia` to run interactive notebooks in the browser.
- Run `Pluto`:
    ```julia
    julia> using Pluto

    julia> Pluto.run()
    ```

[Here you can find a detailed step-by-step guide](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/) to install `Julia` and `Pluto`.
