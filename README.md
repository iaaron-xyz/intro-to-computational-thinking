# Introduction to Computational Thinking

## About the project
This repository contains notes and my own solutions the given homeworks and projects. The main focus of the course is to provide a solid foundation in computational thinking. According to Alan Edelman, one of the creators of `Julia`, computational science can be summed up by a simplified workflow: **data -> input -> process -> model -> visualize -> otput**.

This content is based on the MIT course [MIT 18.S191/6.S083/22.S092 Introduction to Computational Thinking - Spring 2021](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/). The notes are a bit modified by to keep them updated and for addition of extra explanations. The homeworks and the projects contain my own solutions.

## How to run the notes, homeworks and the projects
You must [download and install the programming languaje `Julia`](https://julialang.org/downloads/). After `Julia` is running correctly, install `Pluto`, a package of `Julia` to run interactive notebooks in the borwser and finally download notebooks to work locally with them.

[Here you can find a detailed step-by-step guide](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/) to install `Julia` and `Pluto`.
