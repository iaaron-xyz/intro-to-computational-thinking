# Introduction to Computational Thinking

This repository contains notes, projects and my own solutions to those projects focused on getting a solid foundation in computational thinking. According to Alan Edelman, one of the creators of `Julia`, computational science can be summed up by a simplified workflow: **data -> input -> process -> model -> visualize -> otput**.

This content is based on the MIT course [MIT 18.S191/6.S083/22.S092 Introduction to Computational Thinking - Spring 2021](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/). The notes are a bit modified by to keep them updated and for addition of extra explanations. The homeworks and the projects contain my own solutions.
